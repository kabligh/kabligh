### Hello ðŸŒž

I'm Annabel. After eight years as a news editor and podcast producer, I joined Makers Academy's intensive 12-week bootcamp in October 2020 to kickstart a new career as a full stack developer. I'm excited to learn new things and build cool products that make the world a better place. From March 2021 I'm joining the team at [Contact](https://contact.xyz/) as an Associate Software Engineer.
