### Hello 🌞

I'm Annabel. After eight years as a news editor and podcast producer, I joined Makers Academy's intensive 12-week bootcamp in October 2020 to kickstart a new career as a full stack developer. 

🌵 I'm excited to learn new things and build cool products that make the world a better place  
💃 From March 2021 I'm joining the team at [Contact](https://contact.xyz/) as an Associate Software Engineer  
🐕 My husky, [Hyko](https://www.instagram.com/hykothehusky/), is the [best dog in the world](https://soundcloud.com/luke/best-dog-in-the-world)
