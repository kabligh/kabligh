### Hello 🌞

I'm Annabel. I'm a full stack software engineer at [Contact](https://contact.xyz/).

🌵 I'm excited to learn new technologies (and _things_, in general) and also to build cool products
💃 I worked as a news editor and podcast producer for eight years before making the switch to coding
🐕 My husky, [Hyko](https://www.instagram.com/hykothehusky/), is the [best dog in the world](https://soundcloud.com/luke/best-dog-in-the-world)
